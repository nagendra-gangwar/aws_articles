Troubleshoot the Load Balancer 
1-  Make sure you have listen configured for correct port.
2-  Check the Network Security Group is allowing the port you have configured for listners.
3-  Check the backend instance's network security groups allowing the port you have configured for forwarding. Also check the health check port if it is different.
4-  Check the network ACLs of the VPC where your application hosted.
5-  Check the rout table and see if the traffic is allowed from internet gateway.
6-  Do telnet to the load balancer.
7-  check load related issues.
